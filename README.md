# ProgrammableCampaignJassAI
 
# What is this trash?
It's spaghetti galore, but the endgoal is to provide a primarily campaign AI that can be entirely (or mostly) controller from Jass/Lua using commands sent to the poor thing.
The connection between AI and the game is usually close to "nil", this project is just a small hobby project i created to try and bridge that gap.

This is not ready for use, you should really not use it. But maybe you can use it to learn a thing or two about wc3 AI.
